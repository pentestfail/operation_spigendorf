Security Onion:
Security Onion (http://securityonion.blogspot.com/) is a Linux 
distribution for intrusion detection and network security 
monitoring. Security Onion for Splunk is designed to run 
on a Security Onion server, providing an alternative method 
for correlating events and incorporating field extractions 
and reporting for Sguil, Bro IDS and OSSEC.


Overview:
Splunk for Security Onion provides several dashboards and search 
interfaces for correlating Sguil, OSSEC and Bro IDS log events.


Required Splunk Apps:
Sideview Utils
http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/36405/sideview-utils

Splunk for OSSEC – Splunk v4 version
http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/22285/splunk-for-ossec-splunk-v4-version

Geo Location Lookup Script (powered by MAXMIND)

Prerequisites:
A Security Onion server and a Splunk 5.x installation. 
(Note: when installing Splunk on a Security Onion system there 
will likely be a port conflict for the Splunk web server. 
Port 81 as an alternate port should be a safe alternative.)


Setup Splunk:
Download from www.splunk.com. Install via terminal command:
        sudo dpkg -i splunk-5*.deb

When install completes, we need to start Splunk for the first time:
        cd /opt/splunk/bin
        sudo ./splunk start

After accepting the agreement, you’ll have to pick an alternate 
port for the Splunk web interface since the default is in use. 
You’ll see the following and when prompted to change, choose yes, 
then specify port 81:

        Checking prerequisites...
                Checking http port [8000]: already bound
	ERROR: The http port [8000] is already bound.  Splunk needs to use this port.
	Would you like to change ports? [y/n]: y
	Enter a new http port: 81
	Setting http to port: 81
                Checking http port [81]: open
                Checking mgmt port [8089]: open
                Checking configuration...  Done.

Splunk's built-in way to run at boot time is (as root): 

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk enable boot-start 

with an optional user=foo at the end to run as a certain user. 
It installs proper boot scripts for your OS so you don't need 
to worry about editing /etc/rc.* files:

/opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start


Install Required Splunkbase Apps:
Open Firefox and browse to  http://localhost:81 (or if you used 
an alternate port change accordingly). Change your password, then 
click App > Find More Apps from the menu in the upper right corner. 
Find the following apps and install them.

Install Sideview Utils
Install Splunk for OSSEC - Splunk v4 version
Install Geo Location Lookup Script (powered by MAXMIND)
Install Google Maps
Install Splunk Visualizations
Install Security Onion for Splunk


Configure Bro IDS Inputs:
Depending on how much traffic your sensor monitors, you may need 
to leave some of the Bro inputs disabled to avoid maxing out your 
license. The following are the sourcetypes configured for each 
Bro IDS log data input:
 
	bro_communication - Bro sensor communications
	bro_conn - Connections
	bro_dns - DNS requests
        bro_dpd - Dynamic Protocol Detection
	bro_ftp - FTP activity
        bro_http - HTTP traffic
	bro_irc - IRC activity
        bro_known_certs - Certificates seen
        bro_known_hosts - Hosts seen
        bro_known_services - Services detected
        bro_notice - You definitely want this one enabled
        bro_smtp - SMTP activity
        bro_smtp_entities - SMTP
        bro_software - Software versions detected (incl. vulnerable versions)
        bro_ssh - SSH activity
        bro_ssl - SSL activity 
        bro_syslog - Syslog activity
        bro_weird - Anomalous events


Using Splunk for Security Onion:
I've standardized the source and destination IP fields in the Bro 
IDS and Sguil log field extractions so "src_ip" and "dest_ip" are 
consistent across events.

Log file data inputs are file specific (as opposed to monitoring 
the entire /nsm/bro/logs/current/ directory) primarily for granular 
control over what gets splunked. Depending on your licensing you 
may need to scale back certain logs and this provides an easy way to 
do so. 


SOstat Monitoring:
The SOstat monitoring scripts are configured to run at various 
intervals (in seconds). The default settings are very conservative, 
executing most scripts once a day and status scripts 3 times a day. 
The default configuration is:

Sourcetype			Script									Interval (seconds)
sostat_disk			/opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/disk.sh 				86400	
sostat_ifconfig			/opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/ifconfig.sh 			86400	
sostat_nsm_log_archive 		/opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/nsm_log_archive.sh 		86400	
sostat_nsm_sensor_ps-status	/opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/nsm_sensor_ps-status.sh 		21600	
sostat_nsm_server_ps-status	/opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/nsm_server_ps-status.sh 		21600 	
sostat_nsm_sguil_uncategorized	/opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/nsm_sguil_uncategorized.sh 	86400
sostat_top			/opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin/top.sh 				21600

The default settings can be modified via Splunk Manager > Data 
Inputs > Scripts. Click on the script name in the "Command" column 
to increase/decrease the interval. You can also disable/enable scripts.


Notable Changes:
2.0 - Supports Security Onion 12.04 distribution. If you are running 
Security Onion 10.04 please continue to use version 1.1.7. 
- Splunk 5.0 tested and developed.
- Major updates to Overview and IR Search dashboards.
- Introducing "Bro(wser)" for perusing Bro logs.
- SOstat SO dashboard updated and now consuming snort.stats for Snort 
monitoring.
- Workflows: VirusTotal MD5, DShield.org and IR Search workflow lookups added.
- Lots of other updates and improvements, including new Connections mining.

1.1.7 - Tweaked Sguil indexing to prevent Bro URL data from being duplicated 
into Splunk via sguild.log. 
- Monitors dashboard field name drop down selections added to all panels. 
- General Mining dashboard added panels for Bro SSH logs and Bro HTTP TLDs 
(top level domains). Also added drop down options for Bro FTP and IRC panels. 
- Squil Mining has been updated and improved. 
- Syslog Mining dashboard added for Bro Syslog. 
- An Event Workflow was added for searching Splunk for events by src_ip.
…and last but not least:
- CIF Dashboards!

For the CIF integration to work you need access to a CIF (Collective Intelligence 
Framework - http://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/) server 
in order to export query results to a .csv file for the external lookups.

The CIF integration leverages three files created by exporting CIF query results 
to .csv format. If you don't have access to a CIF server but want a sense of how 
the app works, I've provided three sample files in the lookups folder. Visit 
http://testmyids.com via a browser and you should see results in the CIF dashboards.

IMPORTANT - By including these 3 sample files (that contain NO actual CIF data; 
just fields and a test/sample entry) we prevent Splunk from throwing lookup 
table errors for those who won't use the CIF capability. The drawback is updating 
the Security Onion app will overwrite existing .csv files, so remember to backup 
the lookups/*.csv files prior to future updates or plan to recreate new CIF .csv 
files.
 
The three CIF queries used for development and testing were:

cif -q infrastructure -s medium -c 85 -p csv -O infrastructure.csv
cif -q url -s medium -c 85 -p csv -O url.csv
cif -q domain -s medium -c 65 -p csv -O domain.csv

Once you've created these files you have to do two things:

1) Edit each file removing the "# " (hash followed by space) from the first row of 
each file.
2) Copy the files to /opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion_cif/lookups/

I highly recommend scripting the CIF export, file manipulation and copy/move process.

CIF Lookups:
In the first release there are two dashboards:
- IP Correlation checks dest_ip addresses from the Bro Connection logs indexed 
against the CIF infrastructure.csv export.
- Domain/MD5 Malware Correlation checks Bro HTTP domains and executable files 
downloaded MD5 hashes against CIF.

Both dashboards work the same in that you'll first see a list of IP addresses 
with an event count. Clicking on an IP will provide CIF
related details around the match as well as a list of all activity to the dest_ip 
address. From there you can use the Event workflow menu to splunk deeper.


1.1.6 - Added time charts to Sguil Mining for activity by all 
source types for source/destination IPs
1.1.5 - Performance improvements to SOstat and a minor bug fix to 
Sguil Mining.
1.1.4 - Minor bug fix to IDS rule reference full document lookup.
1.1.3 - Added SOstat IDS Rules: indexes /etc/nsm/rules/*.rules and 
provides an easy to use interface for referencing rules for tuning. 
Sort by classtype, category, enabled status, and/or rule source and 
drilldown on a rule to see it's activity history and the full rule 
entry complete with Splunk event workflow lookups by BugtraqID, CVE 
ID and URL. 

The IDS Rule inputs are disabled by default. You can enable/disable 
them in:

     /opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/local/inputs.conf

or through Manager > Data Inputs in the GUI. You can manually copy 
the *.rules files from /etc/nsm/rules/ to 
/opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/local/rules. In 
/opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/bin there's a couple very 
basic examples (ids_rules_*.sh) on how you can automate the Snort 
rules and rule reference copy/download (requires an Oinkcode for 
the rule reference files). 

Enable it for tuning or if you have Splunk capacity you can index 
the rules on a schedule. For audit purposes and rule status tracking 
over time you can change the ids_rule monitor path to monitor 
/etc/nsm/rules/*.rules.

If you're running Snort registered rules with an Oinkcode, I'd 
strongly recommend at least indexing the rule reference files 
(ids_rules_doc) at least once so you'll have the workflow lookup 
reference capability.

Keep in mind this does not "apply" or manage rules. It simply indexes 
the rules that have been downloaded and allows you to view their 
enabled/disabled state (among other things). It's a reference tool 
for a Snort install using PulledPork for rule management, not a 
replacement for PulledPork!

It is recommended to enable this on Security Onion servers but not 
sensors. If you're interested in a more distributed approach, contact 
me and I can provide some suggestions/guidance. 

- Added VRT reference workflow lookup. For Sguil events with a sig_id, 
you can now use the Events view workflow menu to view the Snort 
signature reference document in a new window, when available.

- Added SOstat ability to sort by sensor to provide                                             
better monitoring of a distributed deployment.

1.1.2 - Workflow field and event search items added for CIF, DShield 
and Robtex. Most panel drilldowns have been changed from table views 
to event listing views. The primary reason (while less aesthetic) is 
accessibility to the workflow queries, which will allow you to 
efficiently query domains, IPs, and hashes without disrupting your 
workflow and visiblity (i.e., results spawn in new windows/tabs).

1.1 - I've added an input for Bro's capture_loss.log which now 
displays on the SOstat Security Onion monitor in a time chart 
paired with Snort packet loss. To enable this log in Bro edit:
     /usr/local/share/bro/site/local.bro
and add the following:
     @load misc/capture-loss
You'll have to check and install Bro for the change to get loaded.
     sudo broctl
     check
     install
     exit
and you're done. It takes a few before the first logged event will 
show so give it a bit before you worry if it's working.

I also tweaked the sguild inputs to exclude "{URL" events. This 
data is already being consumed via bro_http so it should cut down 
on the licensing volume.

Monitors Dashboard
- Returned misc-activity to the Sguil panel. 
- Added date/time and raw event to drill down display for the FTP 
Args panel.

GeoIP
- A drop down list has been added to GeoIP allowing you to search 
GeoIP by sourcetype which should reduce query times for more 
targeted views. The map also now includes drill down capabilities 
with results appearing below the map when selected.

Mining
- Added drill down to the time chart panels for HTTP and SMTP mining
- Added a PADS dashboard (similar to HTTP and SMTP mining) searchable 
by Name, Classification, 
Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP, Destination Port, Protocol, 
and Severity.
- Added a Known Knowns dashboard. Includes: Known Services; Known 
Software searchable by Name and 
Type; and Known Certs searchable by Country, Common Name, Certificate 
Issuer Subject, Location, 
Organization, Organizational Unit, Port Number, State, and Certificate 
Subject.

PADS
- Created an event type for PADS in addition to the PADS Mining 
dashboard.

SOstat
- Updated SOstat SO to include Bro capture loss in addition to Snort 
packet loss.


1.0 - Version 1.0 introduces a visualization of Security Onion data 
flows using the Splunk Visualizations app (available at 
http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/22283/splunk-visualizations).
It can be resource intensive on the viewing browser. Visit 
http://metasplunk.com/projects/particle for details on the experiment 
and which browsers might provide better support. If an Adobe Flash 
update is required, you can install it via Applications>Ubuntu 
Software Center. Search for "Adobe Flash" and click the More Info 
button next to Adobe Flash Plugin, then click install.

Also of note in version 1.0, is a .csv driven dropdown list search 
for bro_http uris matching defined regex values. Dropdown items are 
stored in:

/opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/lookups/mining_uri_values.csv

The .csv file has two fields, value and label, where value is a regex 
value that will be searched for in uris and label is the name you want 
to appear in the drop down. The idea is to provide an easier way for 
users to customize historical searching against recently identified 
uri values to find out who may have hit them before Snort/ET were 
detecting it.

Minor Enhancements:
Overview - Sguil Events now by classification

Monitors - Sguil Events by name with sparkline and excluding OSSEC 
and misc-activity events to reduce clutter.

General Mining - HTTP/SMTP Filenames panel now includes a drop down 
list to search by extension type. The Interesting URI Values panel 
includes a drop down list to search by extension or other regex 
values. Drop down items are stored in 

/opt/splunk/etc/apps/securityonion/lookups/mining_uri_values.csv. 

The .csv file has two fields, value and label, where value is a 
regex value that will be searched for in uris and label is the 
name you want to appear in the drop down. Idea is for historical 
searching against newer active malicious uris to identify 
potential victims retroactively.

HTTP and SMTP mining - Changed to drop down list panels with a 
sparkline table and time chart.

SOstat - Now three dashboards: 
SOstat Security Onion - SO services, sguil events, Snort/Snorby 
details
SOstat *nix - OS specific data, disk, top, ifconfig
Security Onion Data Flow - More of a wow bang than anything, 
this requires the Splunk 
Visualizations app and will show a real time flow of data 
from SO through Splunk. 

Lastly, added header labels to all the dashboards/views to 
aid in navigational awareness.

0.8 - added CIF (Collective Intelligence Framework) query 
capability to the field and event menus in Splunk. For the 
links to work you will need to update the workflow actions 
for your CIF server and a valid API key. Edit the workflow 
via Splunk Manager > Fields > Workflow action from the 
Security Onion app context and you should see two CIF entries.
